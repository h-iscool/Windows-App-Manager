# Windows-App-Manager
This is a recreation of the "Windows-App-Restrictor" project that I was working on. This version aims to be a more efficient and diverce version of that application.

## Features:
 - whitelisting
 - blacklisting
 - controling background apps
 - controling forground apps
 - backwards compatability (incliding the windows app restrictor files)
 - time limits
 - logs
 - events
 - smaller app size than windows app restrictor
 - and more!
[This is still in beta and until 1.0 it will NOT be required to contain all of these]
